# GoPlayer

This is a Go based audio player. 

Just getting this started.

The main goal is to build a personal music player that will play
- mp3
- ogg
- flac

This is going to have a network based option and a local storage option.

Initially there will only be a web interface, but I intend to make a Fyne application to Run on
- Windows
- Linux
- OSx
- Android
- iOS
